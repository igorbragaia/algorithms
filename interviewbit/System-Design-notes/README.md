# System Design Notes

## How to approach a problem?

* **Features** expectations
* **Estimations** (scale required, database sharding, caching, load balancing, etc)
* **Design goals** (latency required, CAP - consistency, availability and partitioning, ACID SQL properties - atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability, BASE NoSQL properties - basic availability, soft-state and eventual consistency)
* **Skeleton** of the Design
* **Deep dive** into above statements - API endpoints, clients requirements, if sharding, how to consistent hash, security, randomness, etc
